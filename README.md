**Task Management System in Prolog**

### Description
This repository contains a simple task management system implemented in Prolog. The program allows users to create, assign, and manage tasks with descriptions and completion statuses. It supports multiple users and demonstrates fundamental Prolog features, including dynamic predicates, conditional logic, and backtracking.

### Features
- Create and assign tasks to multiple users.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Display all tasks or filter tasks by user.
- Retrieve and check task descriptions based on predefined IDs.

### Instructions for Running the Code

#### Prerequisites
- **Prolog Environment**: Make sure you have a Prolog interpreter installed. This code is compatible with SWI-Prolog, which is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

#### Installation Steps

##### For Windows Users:
1. **Install SWI-Prolog**:
   - Download the installer from the [SWI-Prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open Command Prompt (cmd).
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using `cd` command.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
     ```
   - Replace `yourusername` and `repository-name` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.

3. **Run the Prolog Code**:
   - Open SWI-Prolog.
   - Load the Prolog file by navigating to the directory where you cloned the repository:
     ```prolog
     ?- [repository-name]. % Replace with your actual repository name
     ```
   - Start using the predicates defined in the code.

##### For Mac Users:
1. **Install SWI-Prolog**:
   - You can install SWI-Prolog via Homebrew. Open the Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     brew install swi-prolog
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the package from the [SWI-Prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open Terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using `cd` command.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
     ```

3. **Run the Prolog Code**:
   - Open SWI-Prolog.
   - Load the Prolog file:
     ```prolog
     ?- [repository-name]. % Replace with your actual repository name
     ```
   - Use the predicates defined in the code.

##### For Linux Users:
1. **Install SWI-Prolog**:
   - SWI-Prolog can be installed via the package manager. Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install swi-prolog  # For Debian-based distributions
     ```
   - For other distributions, use the respective package manager or download from the [SWI-Prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to the desired directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/directory
     ```
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
     ```

3. **Run the Prolog Code**:
   - Open SWI-Prolog:
     ```bash
     swipl
     ```
   - Load the Prolog file:
     ```prolog
     ?- [repository-name]. % Replace with your actual repository name
     ```
   - Start using the predicates as defined in the code.

### Usage
After loading the Prolog file, you can start creating tasks, assigning them to users, marking tasks as completed, and displaying tasks using the provided predicates. Explore the code and modify it to fit your needs!
